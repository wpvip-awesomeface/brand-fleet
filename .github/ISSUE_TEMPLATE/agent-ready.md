<!-- Applying the agent-ready label starts the agent. This template deliberately
     does not apply it for you: a complexity:high issue needs its complexity label
     on before the agent starts, or it takes the direct path and skips the planning
     phase. Fill this in, add your complexity label, then add agent-ready yourself. -->

## Summary

<!-- One sentence: What needs to be built or fixed? If you need more than one sentence, the scope may be too big. -->

## Context

<!-- Why does this matter? Who uses it? How does it fit into the bigger picture?
     Agents don't have institutional knowledge — give them the "why" so they make good trade-offs. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Define "done" with specific, testable criteria. Each should be verifiable. -->

- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ] Tests pass (unit + integration as appropriate)
- [ ] Passes linting and code standards (project-specific)
- [ ] Code review approved

## Scope

**In scope:**

<!-- Be explicit about what this issue includes -->

-
-

**Out of scope:**

<!-- Explicitly exclude things to prevent scope creep. "Future enhancement" is fine. -->

-
-

## Technical Notes

<!-- Give the agent everything it needs to match your codebase patterns -->

**Key files:**

<!-- Files to create, modify, or use as reference -->

```
- src/path/to/file-to-modify.ext
- src/path/to/pattern-reference.ext  (for reference)
```

**Patterns to follow:**

<!-- Name specific patterns, link to examples in the codebase -->

- See `src/...` for similar implementation
- Follow project coding standards

**Dependencies:**

<!-- Required packages, API keys, environment setup, etc. -->

-

**Testing approach:**

<!-- How should this be tested? What test files to create/update? -->

- Add tests to `tests/` or the project's test directory
-

## Complexity

<!-- Delete the ones that don't apply -->

- [ ] `complexity:low` — Single file, obvious pattern, quick fix
- [x] `complexity:medium` — Multiple files, follows established patterns
- [ ] `complexity:high` — Architectural decisions, new patterns, needs planning phase

## Agent Readiness

<!-- Verify before adding the agent-ready label -->

- [ ] Scope is bounded (can be done in one PR)
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Context explains the "why"
- [ ] Patterns are linked, not assumed
- [ ] No external blockers (APIs available, dependencies installed)
- [ ] Complexity is appropriate for agent execution

<!--
TIPS FOR GOOD AGENT ISSUES:

✅ DO:
- Be specific about file locations
- Link to similar implementations in the codebase
- Define clear boundaries
- Include error cases in acceptance criteria

❌ DON'T:
- Use vague language ("improve", "enhance", "make better")
- Assume the agent knows your conventions
- Combine unrelated changes
- Skip the context section

See docs/AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md for full guidelines.
