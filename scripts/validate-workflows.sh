#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Parses every workflow file under .github/workflows/ and fails if any of them
# is not valid YAML.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/validate-workflows.sh [directory]
#
# Why this exists:
#   A workflow file that does not parse does not fail loudly. GitHub cannot
#   schedule a job it could not read, so the run ends in seconds with no jobs
#   and no log — which reads as a broken command rather than a broken file.
#
#   The usual cause is an unquoted ": " inside a run: line, because a plain YAML
#   scalar containing a colon followed by a space is a mapping, not a string:
#
#     run: echo $(( x > 0 ? 1 : 0 ))      # breaks
#     run: git commit -m "fix: thing"     # breaks too — quotes do not help,
#                                         # the outer scalar is still plain
#
#   Both are lines an agent could reasonably write. A block scalar makes the
#   colon just a character:
#
#     run: |
#       git commit -m "fix: thing"
#
# Exits 0 when every file parses, 1 otherwise.
